The first chapters of Twilight characterize Bella and Charlie's relationship, portraying protagonist Bella as strong and unselfish and her father, Charlie, as a loving but aloof father. Bella admits to various contradicting actions in her first observations after moving to Forks. She excelled in Arizona's heat, but she's opted to relocate to a cold, wet climate. She adores and misses her mother, yet she gladly abandons her to live with the father she hasn't seen since childhood. She's put herself in this awkward predicament because she prioritizes her mother's happiness over her own.
</p>
<p>
Charlie, while joyful and eager to accept his daughter, appears to Bella to be a stranger. Charlie's house is exactly as Bella recalls it, as though frozen in time. Aside from the same kitchen cupboards and furniture, Charlie still displays wedding and family photos, implying that Bella is still a little girl in Charlie's mind. Charlie's police suit and cruiser represent yet another barrier between them, as Charlie is frequently too preoccupied with work to pay much attention to Bella. Early encounters between Bella and Charlie appear strained, implying that theirs will not be an easy relationship.
</p>
<p>
Bella encounters various persons who offer information about Bella and Edward during her first days at Forks High School. While all first-person narrators are somewhat untrustworthy, Bella gives various signs that she does not fully depict herself. Her classmates' reactions to her appearance contradict her claim that she is plain. Several pupils are taken with Bella. Other characters disclose more about Edward than Edward reveals about himself. Bella's first impressions of Edward are based entirely on secondhand information. While she is aware of the Cullens, none of them speak to her personally, so all she has to go on is a rumor. Edward's strange aggressive behavior adds to the enigma around him. When Bella inquires about the Cullens, Charlie responds that they are excellent people who willingly give back to the community. Bella and Edward first notice each other from afar, but because they cannot communicate, the lesser characters assist them in getting to know each other. Bella hears rumors, and Edward hears what classmates think of Bella.
